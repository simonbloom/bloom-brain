# Security Analysis

Review $ARGUMENTS for security vulnerabilities and provide remediation steps with risk assessment.

## Security Investigation Process

1. **Threat Modeling**: Identify potential attack vectors
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Check for known security issues
3. **Code Review**: Analyze for security anti-patterns
4. **Configuration Audit**: Review security settings
5. **Risk Assessment**: Prioritize findings by impact and likelihood

## Security Analysis Areas

- Authentication and authorization
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection and XSS prevention
- CSRF protection
- Secure data storage
- API security
- Dependency vulnerabilities

## Output Format

- **Risk Level**: Critical/High/Medium/Low classification
- **Vulnerability Details**: What the issue is and why it's dangerous
- **Exploitation Scenario**: How an attacker could exploit this
- **Remediation Steps**: Specific code/configuration changes needed
- **Prevention Strategy**: How to avoid similar issues
