- **Web Research**: Security patterns and performance optimizations

## Research Process

### Phase 1: Technology Research
**Context.7 Searches:**
- "Latest [technology] patterns for [feature-type] 2025"
- "[framework] [feature] implementation guide 2025"
- "[technology] best practices and patterns [current-year]"

### Phase 2: Implementation Research
**Brave Search Queries:**
- "[framework] [feature] best practices implementation"
- "[feature] security considerations [current-year]"
- "[technology] performance optimization techniques"

### Phase 3: Pattern Analysis
**Additional Research:**
- API design patterns for similar features
- UI/UX patterns and user experience considerations
